Hello, and welcome to the repository.
This repository holds the code I developed to create a machine-learning-powered interactive design framework that was used to conduct user studies for my thesis.

While many small pieces of code were written elsewhere, the framework is run on Jupyter Notebook. 

If you'd like to try out the framework yourself, please download all files in the repository to a single directory. 
Due to technical difficulties, the seeds used for the freeform task is stored in a separate google drive folder, linked below.

You'll also have to create a conda environment using the framework_env.yml file. Follow the link below for instructions on how to create a conda environment.
https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

Once the environment is set up, open and run Framework_4-{mode}_INTERVIEW_px.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook. Make sure to change project_dir in line 74 to your directory.

Run the server on an external page by clicking the http://localhost:XXXX/ link for a better view of the user interface.
